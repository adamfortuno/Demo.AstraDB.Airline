# ReadMe.md - Database

This folder contains the database scripts

## Connection Info

You may find it easier to create a shell script that exports the connection info for your database. I maintain one of these for each database that I work with so I can quickly switch between them when I use my local command line tools.

```sh
export ASTRA_DB_ID=\<your DB ID\>
export ASTRA_DB_REGION=us-west1
export ASTRA_DB_KEYSPACE=airline
export ASTRA_DB_APPLICATION_TOKEN=\<app_token\>
```

You can find the app token in the shared GoogleDrive folder for this demo
